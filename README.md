# Sight-Obby
Roblox
This is the project I did for the Misi Jelajah Digital organized by Maxis eKelas in 2021. I have achieved first place among the Secondary School Form 5
in the official winners list below: https://lms.ekelas.com.my/senarai-pemenang-cabaran-misi-jelajah-digital/

I made a Malay version of the game for the challenge, but after that I created another two versions of English and Chinese languages in my Roblox profile, and I 
decide to put it open source.

If you just want to try out the game, you can just install Roblox Player and launch the game in the following URL:

If you would like to view how I make the game, feel free to pull my .rblx file in this repository.

I always welcome any suggestions and feedbacks related to my project! 

Cheers!
