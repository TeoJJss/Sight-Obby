# Sight-Obby
Roblox  
This is the project I did for the Misi Jelajah Digital organized by Maxis eKelas in 2021. I have achieved the first place under the Form 5 (secondary school) category: https://lms.ekelas.com.my/senarai-pemenang-cabaran-misi-jelajah-digital/

Initially, I created the game in Malay version as my submission. I created another two versions of English and Chinese languages in my Roblox profile afterwards, and I 
decide to put it open source.  

If you just want to try out the game, you may install Roblox Player and launch the game through the following URL:

If you would like to view the source, feel free to pull my .rblx file from this repository and run with Roblox Studio. 

Cheers!
